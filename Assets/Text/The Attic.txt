Night 1
The Attic
The life of a toy is simple. 
... When the candle shines, we come out to play...
When the light goes out, we become toys once more.
... Humans play us, when they’re bored of us, they throw us out.
They don’t get to do that.
I want to make my own choices. 
I want to wake up when I choose to.
I want to be... human. 
...
What is a human anyways? 
A human moves, a human can see, a human has hair, a human wears clothes, a human feels warm.
The ritual will set me free! The candles are key.
But first
I need to get out of this box...
